# Classifying the location of world flags
In this project I test the ability of various classifiers (KNN, SVM, decision tree, random forest) to predict the location of a country given certain properties of its flag. The data were taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Flags
